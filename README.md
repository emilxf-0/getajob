# Getajob

Getajob is a super bare bones game dev portfolio meant to showcase your work in a more attractive way than just posting a link to your Github account. It's built with Tailwindcss, Jekyll and Alpine.js and is hosted on github pages, making it fairly lightweight and easy to use. Web development can be pretty opaque and I've spent more time than I would've liked wrapping my head around the toolchain and trying to understand how things work. Hopefully I can make it clearer to someone else.

### How it works
TL;DR add the relevant markdown files under the `_projects` folder and update the projects.yml file in the `_data` folder and you're good to go. 

Aight, so the beauty of all this is that Jekyll utilizes Liquid, which is a templating language that saves us from copy pasting hella lot of code and helps us push content to where we want it to be. It looks a bit daunting at first but once you internalize it it's just real smooth sailing. 

### What's included
I've added the necessary setup for tailwind, some basic templating for a start page and a CV.

### Setup
1. Download the zip-file, you'll be setting up your own repo later. 
2. Download and install [NVM Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
3. After NVM is installed open command prompt and run
   ```nvm install node```
4. If you don't have Ruby installed [download it here](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
5. Install Jekyll and Bundler
   ```gem install jekyll bundler```
6. Create your own repo
